# eq
Use Equalizer APO to add those configs
the neweast harman curve by then should be the 2019 one.
I download the data of the two headphones from Github AutoEq, and download the latest harman target curve data as well, then I use matlab for a simple subtract.

The bose soundlink mini II speaker doesn't have a specific measurment. I just tried to find the pleasure spot for my own ear and after eq it sounds good for my ear at most times.

hope you like my eqs
